            <p>After completing my masters degree in Counseling at the College of William and Mary, I spent the next several years working as a clinician in various capacities before transitioning into research with the intention of going back to school for my PhD. However, I had come to realize during this period that I wasn't happy in the field of psychology and, in 2017, I was in a position to quit my job and explore alternatives. Through shadowing other professionals, taking classes, and online research I eventually discovered a love for programming. It came as quite a surprise to me because I had never considered it before, but my passion only grew as I took classes in computer science at IUPUI. When the pandemic hit in 2020, I had been applying for new degrees, but the job I had at the time was disrupted by the pandemic and I had to focus on earning money for a while. Once I resumed practicing as a clinician online to earn a steady income, I was able to look at my options for starting over in programming and chose Butler's Coding Bootcamp so I could begin my new career as soon as possible while still receiving excellent training. I cannot wait to finish earning my certificate and begin working full-time as a developer, and look forward to further opportunities to learn and build on my new craft as a programmer.
